      <p>Lambeth is one of the most diverse and densely populated boroughs in London, with a population of 318,000 residents, according to the 2021 Census. This briefing report provides an overview of the current state of Lambeth, focusing on demographic trends, economic indicators, health and wellbeing trends, and key social issues affecting the borough.</p>
      <p>Lambeth is a diverse and dynamic borough, with a young population and an active economy. However, the borough also faces a range of social and health issues, including high levels of poverty, crime, and STI diagnoses. The local council must work collaboratively with key stakeholders to address these challenges and ensure that all residents can benefit from the opportunities that Lambeth has to offer.</p>
