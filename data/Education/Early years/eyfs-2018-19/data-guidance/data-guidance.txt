Early years foundation stage profile results
2018/19 Academic Year

Description

This document describes the underlying data in the ‘Early years foundation stage profile results: 2018 to 2019’ csv data files.

Coverage

The data covers early years foundation stage profile (EYFSP) assessment results for those children who were in receipt of a government funded early education place at the end of the early years foundation stage only. All providers of state-funded early years education, including: academies; free schools; and private, voluntary and independent (PVI) providers in England are within the scope of the EYFSP data collection. Refer to the technical document for more information on coverage.

In 2018/19, 23 schools piloted a revised set of early learning goals and a revised approach to assessment and moderation. These schools are excluded from the results for 2019.

The underlying data files include national, regional and local authority-level information for England.

File formats and conventions

The three main release files are titled after the key measures contained, followed by the years for which data is available.

The additional characteristics files are titled ‘EYFSP National', followed by the characteristics contained and the years for which data is available.

Footnotes:

1. Average total point score across all the early learning goals (ELGs). This is a supporting measure taking into account performance across all 17 ELGs, 1 point for emerging, 2 for expected and 3 for exceeding. The sum is then taken for all pupils with that characteristic and the mean given.
2. Achieved at least the expected level across all ELGs means a child achieved ‘expected’ or ‘exceeded’ in all 17 ELGs.
3. Children achieving at least the expected level in the ELGs within the three prime areas of learning (personal, social and emotional development; physical development; communication and language) as well as within literacy and mathematics is classed as achieving a 'good level of development'.
4. Achieved at least the expected level in Communication & Language and Literacy are those children who achieved ‘expected’ or ‘exceeded’ in the following early learning goals (ELGs): listening and attention, understanding, speaking, reading and writing.
5. The Communication & Language and Literacy figures in this table are based on data for all children with a valid result for every ELG and may not match those in the additional table published in July 2018 as part of the 2017 statistical release. The figures in the additional table are based on data matched to the national pupil database (NPD) and exclude shielded children and duplicate records.
6. Percentages rounded to 1 decimal place.
